# Forecasting-Gas-Diesel-Prices-

The proposal for this project is to predict the future 2 months gasoline(Regular, Midgrade, Premium) & diesel prices in the United States. Two datasets were obtained as excel files, the gasoline database containing 12 data sheet and the diesel dataset containing 6 data sheets. The desired columns from each dataset were merged into a new dataset.We then applied the Algorithms to forecast the future values use is Holt Winter Exponential Smoothing.

Method:
The Holt-Winters Exponential smoothing.
